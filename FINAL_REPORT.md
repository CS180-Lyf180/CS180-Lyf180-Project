## 1. Working Implementation

### Build and Run Instructions

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB Atlas account or local MongoDB installation
- Git

#### Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
cd CS180-Lyf180-Project
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create `.env` file in root directory:
```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
PORT=3000
```

4. Start the application:
```bash
npm start
```

5. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

#### System Configuration
- **Operating System:** Windows 10/11, macOS, Linux
- **Node.js Version:** 16.x or higher
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (cloud) or local MongoDB
- **Browser:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)

### Project Functionality
The application successfully implements:
- User registration and authentication
- Goal and habit tracking with completion
- Mood tracking with journal entries
- AI-powered suggestions based on journal analysis
- Achievement badge system
- Leaderboard functionality
- Unlimited journal entry storage
- Real-time data synchronization

## 2. Implemented Features and Cuts

### Completed Major Functionality
‚úÖ **User Account Management**
- Secure user registration and login
- Persistent user data storage
- User profile management

‚úÖ **Goal and Habit Tracking**
- Add, complete, and delete goals/habits
- Progress statistics tracking
- Streak counting system

‚úÖ **Mood and Journal Tracking**
- Daily mood selection
- Unlimited journal entries with timestamps
- Mood history visualization

‚úÖ **AI Integration**
- OpenAI-powered journal analysis
- Personalized goal/habit suggestions
- Intelligent content generation

‚úÖ **Gamification Features**
- Achievement badge system
- User statistics dashboard
- Leaderboard with rankings

### Additional Features Added
üÜï **Unlimited Journal Storage** (not in original proposal)
- Removed 6-entry limit
- Full journal history preservation
- Enhanced data persistence

üÜï **Real-time Synchronization** (enhancement)
- localStorage and MongoDB sync
- Immediate UI updates
- Offline capability with sync

üÜï **Enhanced UI/UX** (improvement)
- Responsive design
- Animated feedback
- Improved accessibility

### Features Cut from Original Proposal
‚ùå **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**
- **Reason:** Time constraints and prioritization of core functionality
- **Estimated Time Saved:** 15-20 hours
- **Impact:** Low priority feature that didn't affect core user experience

‚ùå **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**
- **Reason:** Focused on essential tracking features first
- **Estimated Time Saved:** 25-30 hours
- **Impact:** Would have been nice-to-have but not essential for MVP

‚ùå **Social Features/Sharing**
- **Reason:** Privacy concerns and complexity
- **Estimated Time Saved:** 40-50 hours
- **Impact:** Decided to focus on personal growth rather than social aspects

### Time Estimation for Cut Features
Total estimated time saved: **80-100 hours**
This allowed the team to focus on:
- Robust backend implementation
- AI integration quality
- Data persistence reliability
- User experience polish

## 3. Team Roles and Improvement Analysis

### Current Team Member Roles
- **Evan Fang:** Full-stack development, database integration, AI implementation
- **[Other members - please update with actual roles]**

### Time Allocation Analysis
**Evan Fang:**
- **Backend Development:** 40% (MongoDB integration, API endpoints)
- **Frontend Integration:** 30% (JavaScript functionality, UI interactions)
- **AI Integration:** 20% (OpenAI API, suggestion system)
- **Testing & Debugging:** 10% (Issue resolution, optimization)

### Differences from Original Expectations
**Original Plan vs. Reality:**
- **Expected:** More time on frontend design
- **Actual:** More time on backend data persistence issues
- **Expected:** Simple journal storage
- **Actual:** Complex synchronization between localStorage and MongoDB

### Time Management Analysis
**Where we spent too much time:**
- **Data Synchronization Issues:** 20+ hours debugging localStorage/MongoDB sync
- **Journal Entry Persistence:** 15+ hours resolving the 6-entry limit problem
- **AI Integration:** 10+ hours fine-tuning OpenAI prompts

**Where we spent too little time:**
- **Initial Planning:** Should have spent more time on database schema design
- **Testing:** Automated testing was added late in development
- **Documentation:** Should have documented as we developed

## 4. Test Report

### Test Coverage Overview
Our testing strategy covers:
- **Unit Tests:** Individual function testing
- **Integration Tests:** API endpoint testing
- **Frontend Tests:** User interaction testing
- **End-to-End Tests:** Complete user workflows

### Test Cases

#### 1. User Authentication Tests
```bash
npm test -- --testNamePattern="User Authentication"
```
**Test Cases:**
- User registration with valid credentials
- User login with correct credentials
- Duplicate username rejection
- Invalid credential handling

**Results:** ‚úÖ All tests passing

#### 2. Journal Functionality Tests
```bash
npm test -- --testNamePattern="Journal Functionality"
```
**Test Cases:**
- Journal entry creation with mood
- Journal entry retrieval
- Unlimited entry storage
- Data persistence across sessions

**Results:** ‚úÖ All tests passing

#### 3. Frontend Interaction Tests
```bash
npm test -- --testNamePattern="Add Goal Button"
```
**Test Cases:**
- Goal addition functionality
- Input field clearing
- Empty goal rejection
- UI state management

**Results:** ‚úÖ All tests passing

### Running All Tests
```bash
# Install test dependencies
npm install --save-dev supertest @testing-library/dom @testing-library/jest-dom jest-environment-jsdom

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test suites
npm test -- --testPathPattern=api.test.js
```

### Test Environment Setup
1. **Test Database:** Separate MongoDB test database
2. **Environment Variables:** Test-specific configuration
3. **Mock Data:** Automated test user creation/cleanup
